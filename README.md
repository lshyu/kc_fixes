# Vivantech's Kuali Coeus Fixes Project

## Overview
This project contains [Vivantech](www.vivantech.com)'s publicly available fixes to the [Kuali Foundation](www.kuali.org)'s [Kuali Coeus](www.kuali.org/kc) application.  It is designed as a maven war overlay to the Foundation's code.  The base war can be found in Vivantech's [public maven repository](https://jenkins.dev.ekualiti.com/nexus/content/repositories/public/).  The current base war is KC version 5.2.1 and is built from code which can be found at https://svn.kuali.org/repos/kc/tags/kc-release-5_2_1-tag.
